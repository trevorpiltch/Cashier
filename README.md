# Cashier
Welcome to Cashier! Cashier was created by a single developer (hi ðŸ‘‹), in the Spring of 2021. Cashier is your personal expenses tracker, and helps show you where you spend your money. It was handcrafted using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files?fuid=847463189228276007) and XCode. It is written entirely in Swift and uses the CoreData framework to keep all your information private and on device.
